# SD Worx Front-End Challenge

Your challenge this evening is to prepare a website that will present a datatable using the following [API](https://63998da716b0fdad77409a5e.mockapi.io/api/v1/hikers).

Refrain from using any visual frameworks, like bootstrap, Angular material, ngx-ui, or others, while building the webpageâ€‹

You can open the Figma sample to get as close a possible to the premade designsâ€‹. Links can be found in their respective sections below.

The pages must both support desktop and mobile versionsâ€‹
